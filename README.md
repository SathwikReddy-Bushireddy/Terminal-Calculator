## 📘 Project Overview

The **Terminal Calculator** is a simple, menu-based calculator built using **Java**.  
It performs the basic **arithmetic operations** — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division — through a **console interface**.

> 🎯 The project demonstrates **core programming concepts** like user input handling, control flow, loops, and exception management in Java.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Menu-driven interface — easy to navigate  
✅ Supports **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**  
✅ Handles invalid inputs gracefully  
✅ Prevents **division by zero** using exception handling  
✅ Keeps running until the user chooses to exit

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Displays a menu with options:
   
  1.Addition
  2.Subtraction
  3.Multiplication
  4.Division
  5.Exit Calculator
  
2. User chooses an operation.
3. Program asks for two numbers.
4. Performs the chosen operation.
5. Displays the result.
6. Returns to the menu until “Exit” is selected.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **`Scanner`** class for input handling  
- **`while` loop** for continuous execution  
- **`switch` statement** for operation selection  
- **`try-catch` block** for division error handling  
- **Formatted output** using `System.out.printf()`

## 💻 How to Run

### 🧩 Option 1: Run from Command Line

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to your project directory
cd DSA_Project/Terminal_Calculator

# Step 2: Compile the Java file
javac Calculator.java

# Step 3: Run the program
java Calculator
```

🧩 Option 2: Run in an IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code)

Open your IDE.

Create a new Java project named DSA_Project.

Inside it, create a package named Terminal_Calculator.

Paste the code into a file called Calculator.java.

Click Run ▶️ to start the calculator.
